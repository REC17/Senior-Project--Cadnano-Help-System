&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The delete button is used to remove the final helix displayed on the path view.  If the path order has not been altered by the user, then the helices will be removed in reverse order in which they were added to the path view, meaning that the most recently added helix will be removed.  The order of deletion is not related to the numbering of the helices, it is dependent on the organization of the helices in the path view.
