&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click this button to toggle on to move mode.  When move mode is enabled, the cursor icon changes into a cross-hair icon.  Click anywhere within the slice view and drag the mouse to move the slice helix template within the slice view.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mode is useful for large origami designs that may extend beyond the borders of the slice view.  Alternatively, it may be useful to expand the slice view to fill the entire application space by stretching its borders and collapsing the other panels.
