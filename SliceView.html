<H2>Slice View</H2>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slice view is where the DNA origami design is initiated.  The slice view displays a template of helices either in a hexagonal configuration or a square configuration.  The physical ramifications and implications of each configuration are explained in the “Origami Concepts” section of the help contents.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each circle in the template represents a “straight” segment of DNA, the length of which can be specified later on in the design process.  To add a helix to the origami structure, choose the helix selection tool and click on the desired helix.  Notice that a number will appear in the circle when the circle is clicked.  This number acts as a reference tool for the user in order to coordinate between the helical configuration in the slice view and the path view.  Odd and even numbers indicate the directionality of the scaffold strand on the helix.  Odd number helices have their 3’ ends coming out of the page, and even helices have their 5’ ends coming out of the page.  Identical helical configurations may have different numbering assignments depending on the order in which the helices are clicked, but this disparity has no effect on the logistics of the design, the numbers are just for reference.
