&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This button allows the user to renumber the helices according to the order in which they were originally selected.  Renumbering can only occur if the helices have been reordered in the path view.  Shuffling odd numbered helices with respect to even numbered helices and vice versa does not impact renumbering.
