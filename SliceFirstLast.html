&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The “First” and “Last” buttons are used to quickly shift the slice bar to the furthest ends of the path view.  Pressing the “First” button will move the slice bar to the 3’ end of the odd numbered paths and the 5’ end of the even numbered paths in the path view.  Conversely, pressing the “Last” button will move the slice bar to the 5’ end of odd numbered paths and the 3’ ends of even numbered paths in the path view.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These buttons act as shortcuts that enable the user to quickly poise the path view layout to enable the user to execute other functions that require the slice bar to be positioned at the edges of the path layout.  Click here to view help content on the slice bar.
